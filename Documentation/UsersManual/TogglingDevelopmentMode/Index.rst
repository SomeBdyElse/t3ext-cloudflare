Toggling development mode
-------------------------

An orange gear icon in the toolbar lets you manage your domains /
zones:

|development-mode|

Development mode is a way for you to make changes to your site, and
see the changes immediately. By entering development mode, you will
bypass CloudFlare's proxy and suppress minification. As a result, as
you make changes to images, CSS or Javascript, the changes will appear
immediately. Development mode stays on for three (3) hours and then
automatically toggles off.
